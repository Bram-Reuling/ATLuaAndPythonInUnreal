# ATLuaAndPythonInUnreal
**Disclaimer**: I know that pushing dll files to GitHub is not good practice, but I did it in this case so you didnt have to search and download them for yourself. To make the project work, please copy the dll files from `Source/ThirdParty/LuaLibrary/x64/Release` and `Source/ThirdParty/PythonLibrary/x64/Release` into the `Binaries` folder of the project.
