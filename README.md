# ATLuaAndPythonInUnreal
**Disclaimer**: I know that pushing dll files to GitHub is not good practice, but I did it in this case so you didnt have to search and download them for yourself. To make the project work, please copy the dll files from `Source/ThirdParty/LuaLibrary/x64/Release` and `Source/ThirdParty/PythonLibrary/x64/Release` into the `Binaries` folder of the project. I am also fully aware of the fact that Unreal Engine comes with Python already installed so I could have used that, but instead I went with importing my own because that is Python 3.11. The version included by Unreal Engine is Python 3.8.

Please read wiki for explanation on what this repository is about.
